Help on class Grabber in module imagingcontrol4.grabber:

class Grabber(builtins.object)
 |  Grabber(dev: Union[str, imagingcontrol4.devenum.DeviceInfo, NoneType] = None)
 |
 |  Represents an opened video capture device, allowing device configuration and stream setup.
 |
 |  The Grabber object is the core component used when working with video capture devices.
 |
 |  Some objects, e.g. :py:class:`.ImageBuffer`, can keep the device and/or driver opened as long as they exist,
 |  since they point into device driver memory. To free all device-related resources,
 |  all objects references have to be deleted, or ImageBuffer objects have to release their internal
 |  reference by calling their :py:meth:`.ImageBuffer.release` function.
 |
 |  Args:
 |      dev (DeviceInfo|str|None): An optional identifier or device information object that represents a
 |                                 video capture device that is to be immediately opened by the Grabber object.
 |
 |  Raises:
 |      TypeError: dev is neither :class:`.DeviceInfo`, `str` nor `None`.
 |      IC4Exception: An error occurred. Check :attr:`.IC4Exception.code` and :attr:`.IC4Exception.message`
 |                    for details.
 |
 |  Note:
 |      If the passed identifier does not uniquely identify a connected device by its model name, unique name,
 |      serial, user-defined name, IPV4 address or MAC address, the function fails with :py:attr:`.ErrorCode.Ambiguous`.
 |
 |  Methods defined here:
 |
 |  __del__(self)
 |
 |  __init__(
 |      self,
 |      dev: Union[str, imagingcontrol4.devenum.DeviceInfo, NoneType] = None
 |  )
 |      Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.
 |
 |  acquisition_start(self) -> None
 |      Start the acquisition of images from the video capture device.
 |
 |      Raises:
 |          IC4Exception: An error occurred. Check :attr:`.IC4Exception.code` and :attr:`.IC4Exception.message`
 |                        for details.
 |
 |      Note:
 |          A data stream has to be established before calling :py:meth:`.acquisition_start` or by
 |          using :py:meth:`.stream_setup`. This operation is equivalent to executing the `AcquisitionStart` command
 |          on the video capture device's property map.
 |
 |  acquisition_stop(self) -> None
 |      Stops the acquisition of images from the video capture device.
 |
 |      Raises:
 |          IC4Exception: If the acquisition could not be stopped. Check :attr:`.IC4Exception.code` and
 |                        :attr:`.IC4Exception.message` for details.
 |
 |      Note:
 |          Acquisition has to be started using :py:meth:`.acquisition_start` or :py:meth:`.stream_setup` before
 |          calling acquisition_stop. This operation is equivalent to executing the `AcquisitionStop` command on
 |          the video capture device's property map.
 |
 |  device_close(self) -> None
 |      Close the currently opened video capture device.
 |
 |      If there is an aqcuisition active, the acquisition is stopped.
 |      If there is a stream established, the stream is stopped.
 |
 |      Raises:

 |        Bytes and bytearray are examples of built-in objects that support the
 |        buffer protocol.
 |      byteorder
 |        The byte order used to represent the integer.  If byteorder is 'big',
 |        the most significant byte is at the beginning of the byte array.  If
 |        byteorder is 'little', the most significant byte is at the end of the
 |        byte array.  To request the native byte order of the host system, use
 |        sys.byteorder as the byte order value.  Default is to use 'big'.

Help on function try_pop_output_buffer in module imagingcontrol4.queuesink:

try_pop_output_buffer(self) -> Optional[imagingcontrol4.imagebuffer.ImageBuffer]
    Tries to retrieve a buffer that was filled with image data from the sink's output queue.

    In contrast to :py:meth:`.pop_output_buffer`, this function does not raise an exception
    in case of an error.

    This operation is only valid while the sink is connected to a device in a data stream.

    The buffers are retrieved in order they were received from the video capture device; the oldest image is
    returned first.

    After a successfull call, the program owns the image buffer through the :py:class:`.ImageBuffer` reference.
    The image buffer object must be deleted, or :py:meth:`.ImageBuffer.release` must be called to put the image
    buffer into the sink's free queue for later reuse.

    Returns:
        Optional[ImageBuffer]: A filled image buffer, or `None` if no image was available.

 |        is length 1.
 |      byteorder
 |        The byte order used to represent the integer.  If byteorder is 'big',
 |        the most significant byte is at the beginning of the byte array.  If
 |        byteorder is 'little', the most significant byte is at the end of the

 |      bytes
 |        Holds the array of bytes to convert.  The argument must either
 |        support the buffer protocol or be an iterable object producing bytes.
 |        Bytes and bytearray are examples of built-in objects that support the
 |        buffer protocol.
 |      byteorder
 |        The byte order used to represent the integer.  If byteorder is 'big',
 |        the most significant byte is at the beginning of the byte array.  If
 |        byteorder is 'little', the most significant byte is at the end of the
 |        byte array.  To request the native byte order of the host system, use
 |        sys.byteorder as the byte order value.  Default is to use 'big'.
 |      signed
 |        Indicates whether two's complement is used to represent the integer.
 |

 |      Helper for pickle.
 |
 |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 |  Data descriptors inherited from enum.Enum:
 |
 |  name
 |      The name of the Enum member.
 |
 |  value
 |      The value of the Enum member.
 |
 |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 |  Static methods inherited from enum.EnumType:
 |
 |  __contains__(value)
 |      Return True if `value` is in `cls`.
 |
 |      `value` is in `cls` if:
 |      1) `value` is a member of `cls`, or
 |      2) `value` is the value of one of the `cls`'s members.
 |      3) `value` is a pseudo-member (flags)
 |
 |  __getitem__(name)
 |      Return the member matching `name`.
 |
 |  __iter__()
 |      Return members in definition order.
 |
 |  __len__()
 |      Return the number of members (no aliases)
 |
 |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 |  Readonly properties inherited from enum.EnumType:
 |
 |  __members__
 |      Returns a mapping of member name->value.
 |
 |      This mapping lists all enum members, including aliases. Note that this
 |      is a read-only view of the internal mapping.
