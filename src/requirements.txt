# requirements.txt

PyQt5>=5.15.0,<5.16
pyserial>=3.5,<4.0
opencv-python>=4.5,<5.0
matplotlib>=3.5,<3.9
numpy>=1.20,<2.0 
# Using tilde for numpy as opencv and matplotlib can be sensitive
# to very new major versions of numpy. <2.0 ensures it stays on 1.x for now.
# If your original numpy==2.2.5 works, you can use that, but this is safer for wider compatibility.
