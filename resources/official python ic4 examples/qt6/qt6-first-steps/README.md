Qt6 First Steps with Python
===========================

This example shows the steps necessary to display live images from a camera in a PySide6 (Qt6) application.

To run, the following packages must be installed in the active Python environment:

- PySide6
- imagingcontrol4
- imagingcontrol4pyside6

The example makes use of the pre-built device selection dialog (`imagingcontrol4.pyside6.DeviceSelectionDialog`) and the display widget (`imagingcontrol4.pyside6.DisplayWidget`).
