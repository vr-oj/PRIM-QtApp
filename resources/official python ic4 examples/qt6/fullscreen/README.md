# Fullscreen Live Display

This example program shows how to show live images from one or more cameras in fullscreen mode.

The program looks for `*.json` files containing device state information in the working directory and opens all configured cameras.

If there are no JSON files available, all available cameras will be opened and shown with their default settings.

Please note: For simplicity, this program does not save any camera settings.

Use *ic4-demoapp* to configure the cameras and save their configuration by clicking *Export Device Settings* in the *Device* menu.
